# Lab 1: Exploring Datasets and Visualization

Welcome to my Lab 1 project for my Stats class! In this lab, I explored various datasets using R and created different types of visualizations to understand the data better

## What's Included

- **Lab1_Script.R**: The R script with code (and comments) used for the analysis

## Highlights

- **Explored the famous iris dataset** to calculate statistical measures and create histograms
- **Analyzed spearhead findings** across different rivers and visualized the data using bar charts
- **Investigated children's ice cream flavor preferences** and represented the data in a pie chart
- **Plotted US monthly gas usage** over time to observe trends using a time series plot

## How to Run the Code

1. **Install the necessary packages** in R:
   ```r
   install.packages("readxl")
   install.packages("ggplot2")
   install.packages("USgas")
