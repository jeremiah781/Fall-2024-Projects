# Lab 2: Statistical Analysis and Regression

Welcome to Lab 2 of my Stats 200 course! This project explores the Iris dataset to analyze measurements of different Iris flower species using R. Here, I calculate statistical measures, create visualizations, and perform correlation and regression analysis.

## Overview

This lab focuses on understanding the relationships between flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) across three Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Key goals included calculating central tendencies and spread, comparing results across species, and using regression to identify patterns.

### Project Structure

- **lab2_script.R**: R script with code for data analysis and visualization
- **lab2_report.docx**: Lab report detailing analysis, graphs, and interpretations
- **data/**: Folder containing the Iris dataset (`iris.xls`)
- **graphs/**: Saved graphs such as boxplots, scatterplots, and regression plots
- **screenshots/**: Screenshots of code and data views to support the report

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Central Tendency and Spread**: Calculated mean and standard deviation for sepal and petal measurements, with species comparisons
2. **Boxplots**: Visualized distributions and identified outliers for each variable
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Assessed linear relationships among variables
4. **Regression Analysis**: Created regression models to explore predictive relationships, plotting regression lines for each species

## Running the Code

To reproduce this analysis, open **lab2_script.R** in R or RStudio. Install any necessary packages (`readxl`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggpubr`) and set your working directory to the `lab2_stats` folder. Run the script to generate outputs and save graphs.

## About This Lab

This lab was completed as part of my Statistics course. The primary objective was to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression techniques to gain insights into relationships among flower measurements and their variation across species.
